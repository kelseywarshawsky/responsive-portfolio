                     My experience to date goes across Healthcare- in critical care, healthcare data, electronic medical records, medical billing, specimen processing, and most recently clinical research. I have an Associate's of Applied Science degree in Respiratory Therapy. My pursuit of knowledge and expanded skill set has been a passion for me, leading me to push into new challenges and growth opportunities. In the future I hope to continue my education and develop my skills, chase new dreams, and develop myself further. If you have a project that seems like a challenge, I'm hoping to blow past your expectations.  <br><br>
                     In my spare time you'll find me painting (or trying to learn), cooking, and adopting too many cats. I really enjoy a great book, sampling the latest craft beers, or spending time with my family. I love to spend my summers camping with my dad or on my family's farm with my niece and nephews. </span>
